    context:"Google is scaling Gmail from invite-only beta to full public launch. Engineering has bandwidth for ONE major feature push before launch. The team debates: (A) Universal search across email, contacts & Drive files — massive dev effort, high wow-factor, used daily by all users. (B) Priority Inbox using ML to auto-sort important emails — moderate effort, solves real pain, but algo needs tuning.",
    question:"Using RICE scoring (Reach × Impact × Confidence ÷ Effort), which feature should Google prioritize for Gmail's public launch?",
    answers:[
      {label:"A – Universal search across email, contacts & Drive", reason:"Reach: 100% of users. Impact: 3x (massive daily utility). Confidence: 90% (search is Google's core strength). Effort: 8. RICE ≈ 33.8", correct:true},
      {label:"B – Priority Inbox ML sorting", reason:"Reach: 60% of power users. Impact: 2x. Confidence: 70% (algo risk). Effort: 7. RICE ≈ 12.0 — lower than search"},
      {label:"C – Rich HTML email composer", reason:"Reach: 80%. Impact: 1.5x. Confidence: 95%. Effort: 5. RICE ≈ 22.8 — solid but not transformational"},
      {label:"D – Google Talk integration inside Gmail", reason:"Reach: 40%. Impact: 2x. Confidence: 80%. Effort: 6. RICE ≈ 10.7 — limited reach hurts the score"}
    ],
    outcome:"Google shipped universal search at Gmail launch in April 2007. It became a defining differentiator — users could search 15GB+ of email instantly. Priority Inbox came in 2010 after the ML model matured. The RICE calculus was clear: search had maximum reach and Google's highest confidence domain.",

(B) Street View expansion to 50 new cities. (C) Real-time traffic from crowd-sourced GPS data. (D) Transit directions for public transport.",
    question:"Using MoSCoW prioritization, which feature belongs in 'Must Have' for the Android Maps 4.0 launch?",
    answers:[
      {label:"A – Turn-by-turn voice navigation (free GPS killer)", reason:"Must Have: Directly disrupts a $3B hardware market, enables Android to leapfrog iPhone Maps, irreplaceable by workaround. Google shipped this free in Oct 2009.", correct:true},
      {label:"B – Street View expansion to 50 new cities", reason:"Should Have: Valuable engagement feature but users can still navigate without it. Doesn't change Android's competitive position vs iPhone."},
      {label:"C – Real-time crowd-sourced traffic", reason:"Should Have: High value but requires data density — needs user base first. Waze acquisition (2013) later solved this at scale."},
